          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Common element types include meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements</li>
            <li>List elements include ordered lists(ol) and unordered lists(ul)</li>
            <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
            <li>The “title” element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
            <li>The “style” element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The “base” element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The “link” element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The “meta” element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
            <li>The “script” element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
            <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as “div” to create a division in the page, or “span” to create an inline division.</li>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside (for example, “head”). Closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, “/head”)</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a “style” element in the “head” element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. </li>
            <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a “link” element placed in the HTML's “head”</li>
            <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document.</li> <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer</li>
            <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work</li>
            <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
            <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
            <li>Use the console.log method to log the variable to the web console in the browser</li>
            <li>Connect script.js to index.html by adding a “script” element under the “footer”</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
            <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.
            <li>Each item is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need.</li>
            <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
