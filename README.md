# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My Prework Study Guide was created to help me begin learning boot camp topics and to create one centralized location to keep notes on what I have learned so far. It contains sections with notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, review the notes in each different section. For a suggestion on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
